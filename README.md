# reddit-snoo-generator

A small Reddit Snoo generator built with React, TypeScript and Material UI.

## Development

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for the dev server and build step.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

When the dev server starts it prints a local address (usually `http://localhost:5173`).
Open that URL in your browser to see the generator UI.
